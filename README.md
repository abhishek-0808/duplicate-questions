# Duplicate Question Pairs Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying duplicate question pairs, utilizing the Quora Question Pairs dataset. Duplicate questions on platforms like Quora can lead to fragmentation of answers and diminish user experience. By detecting duplicates, we can consolidate answers and enhance user satisfaction.

## Project Overview
- Objective: To build a machine learning model for binary classification of question pairs as duplicates or non-duplicates.
- Justification: Addressing the issue of duplicate questions on Q&A platforms to improve user experience and streamline information.
- Methodology: Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques for feature extraction and various machine learning algorithms for model training.

## Phases of Work
1. Data Analysis and Preparation:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Dataset splitting for training and testing
2. Feature Engineering:

- Utilizing NLP techniques for feature extraction
- Generating features such as word embeddings, similarity scores, and word counts
3. Model Building and Evaluation:

- Training and evaluating different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost)
- Performance comparison using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Metrics for Evaluation and Monitoring
- Primary Metric: F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
- Secondary Metric: Accuracy
- Other Metrics: Precision, recall
